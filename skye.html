        <h1>For an anonymous Skye on valorant:</h1>
        <p>Dear Head of UC Admissions,<br>
            On one eventful evening at my local Almaden library I humbly decided to partake in a
            recreational game of Valorant. Although I recognize that the game is often perceived as 
            degenerate and aggressive, I was innocent minded about the hate I was to receive on that 
            fateful day. In fact, it was only my second attempt at the game and I was still insecure
            in my abilities. However, deciding to take a leap of faith, I proudly clicked to start 
            matching for a game. Little did I know, the character Skye which I now despisingly have
            doted as Cabbage Patch would be absolutely disrupting of my Valorant career which would
            have otherwise, without a doubt, become a professional in. The Skye in game would go on
            to blind me and then, trash talk my abilities. By the end of the game, I felt mentally
            defeated, but I had bested my inhumane, almost not human opponent. If the individual
            who played the character Skye on this life-changing day happens to apply to a UC in this
            cycle, I would highly encourage to rescind their prospective offer due to their 
            unsportsmanship and pure disregard for human life.<br>
            Lovingly,<br>
            Quynh Do (a hating hater)
