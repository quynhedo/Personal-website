        <h1>For Joy: </h1>
        <p> Dear Dean of Admissions at UCLA,
            <br>
            Joy is an individual who has applied to be in your honorable class of 2029. However,
            despite how this young woman may appear on paper, I am here to reveal the devastating
            truth. Joy tends to be extremely deceitful and a negative influence on her peers. With
            great shame, I hope to express to you the unsettling nature I witness in Joy's character.
            Day after day, Joy calls her closest friends odd insults such as weirdo and furry. Such
            comments are not appropriate for a future Bruin. So, unfortunately, I regret to inform
            you that the bright young woman you may consider for the UCLA class of 2029 is not as she
            seems. 
            <br>
            Best regards,
            <br>
            Quynh Do (a victim)
        </p>
