        <h1>For Janele:</h1>
        <p>Dear Head of UC Admissions,
            <br>
            According to my heavily skewed dice, Janele is predicted to be rejected from all UC 
            schools with the exception of UCLA. Her long anticipated week will be filled with sadness
            with the exception of when she bursts out in joy out of the pure, childlike exhilaration 
            of being accepted into such a beautiful and highly regarded school. As a dear friend, I would
            truly share Janele's happiness, if not for her tormenting attitude towards her peers.
            Collectively, the coalition of Janele's aquantainces have decided that Janele's seeming spunk
            for life has turn into a dark, jealous competition against others. Rather than owning up to
            her wild adolescent desires to indulge in all sorts of innocent endeavors, she is so adamant
            to maintain an air of superiority by asking for a healthy gift--dried plums. I'm afraid that
            Janele is unwilling to commit to her true self and as such, I sadly inform you that as fellow
            competition, she is unfit as a part of the Bruin class of 2029.
            <br>
            Best regards,
            <br>
            Quynh Do (just a worried acquantaince)
